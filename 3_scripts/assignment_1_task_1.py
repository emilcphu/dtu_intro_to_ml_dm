## Set URL for raw data
url_raw_data = "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1DEmiVdf5UGOo8lqNvNiiHqJQuiNCgxc2" ## This is a download url for a text file located on google drive. The original dataset is only available as a .rdata file (r data file). Thus, we have downloaded a text version and uploaded to a google drive server instead. 


## Load raw data file (South African Heart Disease dataset)
df_heart_disease = pd.read_csv(url_raw_data)

## Initial data manipulations
df_heart_disease = df_heart_disease.drop(columns = "row.names", axis = 1) ## erases column 'row.names'. Axis = 1 indicates it is a column rather than row drop.

## Show content of dataframe
df_heart_disease.head()
